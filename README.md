### Usage
1. To analyze your iMessage history, ensure your messages are backed up on a Mac. If they are not already backed up, you can sync your iMessages to iCloud, download them onto your Mac, and then disable iCloud syncing.
2. Copy the chat.db file to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cp ~/Library/Messages/chat.db ~/<path to repo>/chat.db
    ```
